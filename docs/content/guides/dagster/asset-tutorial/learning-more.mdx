# Learning More

If you’ve made it this far, you likely have an understanding of the basics of software-defined assets.

You might discover that your needs start to outgrow these basics. This page offers a survey of Dagster's full capabilities and where to learn about each of them in our docs.

### Schedules and Sensors

The basic tutorial covered how to manually materialize assets. In production, it’s common to set up Dagster to re-materialize assets automatically. [Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) enable launching runs at fixed cadences. [Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) enable launching runs when your code senses that something has occurred, like a file has been uploaded to a server, or a different asset was rematerialized.

### Partitions

The basic tutorial covered assets whose entire contents get re-computed and overwritten every time the asset is materialized. When assets are large, it’s common to [partition](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitions) them, so that each run only materializes a single partition.

Partitions can be combined with schedules to, e.g., create a job that runs daily and materializes a partition corresponding to the date.

### IO Managers

The assets in the basic tutorial were materialized as pickle files on the local filesystem. [IO managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) enable customizing how and where assets are stored - e.g. you might store assets in a table in Snowflake or a Parquet file in S3.

### Graphs and Ops

The basic tutorial only included assets that were generated by one op, and each op only generated one asset. The relationships between assets and the computations that materialize them can get more complicated.

For example:

- You might want a single op to generate multiple assets at once.
- You might want a graph of ops to be responsible for generating an asset.
- You might want to define a generic op or graph of ops and use it for generating different assets.

### Metadata

The assets in the basic tutorial were unadorned. You can attach metadata to an asset definition, e.g. the columns that it's expected to include or the team that owns it. You can also record metadata at the time that an asset is materialized, e.g. the number of rows in a table or the number of records that violate a particular constraint.

This metadata gets rendered in Dagit, and you can chart it over time.
